- Hi, Jacob Manini
- I’m interested in games, anime, hiking, and swimming
- I’m currently learning about Hawaiian Culture
- I'm originally from Papakōlea
- I'm a Junior in Computer Engineering
- I chose my major because I enjoy all aspects of computer engineering
- A fun fact about me is:  I can count to 31 on one hand
- What do I want to learn from EE 205?  I want to relearn C and C++
- A book or movie I'd recommend is:  All Quiet on the Western Front
